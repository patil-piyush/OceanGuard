Place the oil spill image you attached to the project here and name it `hardcoded_oil_spill.jpg`.

Path: `frontend\public\assets\doil.jpg`

This image will be used as the fixed visual result for oil spillage analysis when running the demo.

Notes:

- The development server serves files from `frontend/public` at the site root. The image will be available at `/assets/hardcoded_oil_spill.jpg`.
- Geolocation and other analysis behavior remain unchanged; only the image shown in the analysis panel is forced to this file for demo purposes.
